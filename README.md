# awesome-prompts
A non-curated list of awesome prompts for your favorite shells!

**NOTE** This project is ongoing, so just because you don't see your favorite shell here does not mean we have some religious hatred toward your shell - it just means we haven't ported any of the prompts yet to your shell.

Pull requests will be greatly appreciated!

## Usage
All the prompts in this repository are designed to be used as such:
```powershell
# in your profile
. "path/to/prompt.sh
```
Simply download the appropriate file from any of the prompts in this repository and add it to `~`, then reference or `source` it in your shell's profile.

## Adding your prompt
All prompts that follow the following rules are welcome:
- Prompt must either be awesome or mimic an awesome prompt from another shell.
- The prompt must be written by the person submitting the prompt. (No submitting code you didn't write!!)
- The prompt must be self-contained, i.e. should not be spread out over more than one file.
- Prompt **must** be completely cross-platform.
- **(Optional)** Prompt code should be compatible with all recent versions of their respective shells.
    - E.g. a PowerShell prompt should be compatible with both PowerShell 5 and PowerShell 6.
